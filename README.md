# From-Excel-to-Datalog

This python script will create a text file (database.dl) and will populate it with data from excel tables.

If you dont have python installed you can install from  https://www.python.org/downloads/

I recommend using PyCharm (Community Edition) to run this script.  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
You can also execute on Visual Studio Code installing the python extension (which is probably going to be recommended by VS Code automatically)

Check the comments on the code for more detailed information on how the script works.
