# From-Excel-to-Datalog

This python script will create a text file (database.dl) and will populate it with data from excel tables.

If you dont have python installed you can install from  https://www.python.org/downloads/

I recommend using PyCharm (Community Edition) to run this script.  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

Check the comments on the code for more detailed information on how the script works.
